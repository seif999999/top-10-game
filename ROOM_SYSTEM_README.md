# Multiplayer Room System

This document describes the complete multiplayer room system implementation for the React Native trivia app.

## Overview

The room system allows players to create and join multiplayer game rooms using 6-character alphanumeric room codes. All data is stored in Firestore and updates in real-time.

## Files Created

### 1. `src/services/roomService.ts`
Main service file containing all room-related functions:

- `createRoom(hostId: string, maxPlayers?: number): Promise<string>`
- `joinRoom(roomCode: string, playerId: string): Promise<void>`
- `leaveRoom(roomCode: string, playerId: string): Promise<void>`
- `subscribeToRoom(roomCode: string, callback: (roomData) => void): Unsubscribe`
- `updateRoomGameState(roomCode: string, gameState: string, category?: string): Promise<void>`
- `getRoomData(roomCode: string): Promise<RoomData | null>`
- `isRoomHost(roomCode: string, playerId: string): Promise<boolean>`

### 2. `src/screens/RoomTestScreen.tsx`
Complete test screen with UI for testing all room functionality:

- Create room buttons
- Join room input and button
- Real-time player list display
- Host controls for game state changes
- Leave room functionality

### 3. `src/utils/roomServiceTests.ts`
Programmatic tests for validating room service functionality:

- `testBasicRoomWorkflow()` - Tests complete create/join/update flow
- `testErrorScenarios()` - Tests error handling
- `testRoomCapacity()` - Tests room capacity limits
- `runAllTests()` - Runs comprehensive test suite

## Room Data Structure

```typescript
interface RoomData {
  roomCode: string;           // 6-character alphanumeric code
  hostId: string;            // ID of the room creator
  players: string[];         // Array of player IDs
  gameState: 'waiting' | 'starting' | 'in-progress' | 'finished';
  createdAt: Date;           // Room creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date;           // Last update timestamp
  maxPlayers?: number;       // Maximum players (default: 4)
  category: string;          // Game category (REQUIRED for multiplayer)
}
```

## Firestore Collection Structure

```
/rooms/{roomCode}
{
  roomCode: "ABC123",
  hostId: "user_123",
  players: ["user_123", "user_456", "user_789"],
  gameState: "waiting",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
  maxPlayers: 4,
  category: "Movies"  // Required - all players use this category
}
```

## Multiplayer Flow Integration

### ðŸŽ¯ **NEW: Complete Category Integration**

The multiplayer system now seamlessly integrates with the existing category system:

1. **Category Selection**: User chooses from existing categories (Sports, Movies, Music, etc.)
2. **Room Management**: Category is stored in room document and synced across all players
3. **Real-time Sync**: All players see the chosen category instantly via Firestore listeners
4. **Game Flow**: Room category automatically passed to game screen

### ðŸ“± **Navigation Flow**

**Updated Multiplayer Flow:**

**Host Flow (Category Selection):**
```
Main Menu â†’ Multiplayer â†’ Multiplayer Mode Select â†’ Create Room (Host)
â†“
Categories Screen â†’ Select Category (e.g., "Movies")
â†“
MultiplayerRoom Screen â†’ Room created with category
â†“
Room Screen â†’ Shows category, players, host controls, real-time updates
â†“
Start Game â†’ Game Screen (category: Movies)
```

**Player Flow (Join Room):**
```
Main Menu â†’ Multiplayer â†’ Multiplayer Mode Select â†’ Join Room (Player)
â†“
JoinRoom Screen â†’ Enter room code
â†“
MultiplayerRoom Screen â†’ Shows HOST'S chosen category
â†“
Room Screen â†’ Wait for host to start, see real-time updates
â†“
Host starts â†’ Game Screen (same category as host)
```

**Single Player Flow (unchanged):**
```
Main Menu â†’ Single Player
â†“
Categories Screen â†’ Select Category
â†“
Question Selection â†’ Choose specific question
â†“
Game Screen â†’ Plays selected question
```

## Key Features

### Room Code Generation
- Generates unique 6-character alphanumeric codes (A-Z, 0-9)
- Includes collision detection and retry logic
- Maximum 10 attempts to generate unique code

### Real-time Updates
- Uses Firestore's `onSnapshot` for real-time room data updates
- Automatic conversion of Firestore timestamps to Date objects
- Subscription cleanup handling

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for common scenarios
- Validation for room existence, capacity, and game state
- Graceful handling of network issues

### Security Features
- Room codes are case-insensitive and normalized to uppercase
- Player ID validation
- Host-only operations protected

## Testing the System

### Method 1: Using the Test Screen (Recommended)
1. Launch the app and log in
2. Navigate to Main Menu
3. Tap on "Room Test" button
4. Use the UI to:
   - Create a room and note the code
   - Join rooms using codes
   - Test real-time updates by having multiple devices/simulators

### Method 2: Programmatic Testing
```typescript
import { runAllTests } from '../utils/roomServiceTests';

// Run in a React component or debug console
runAllTests().then(() => {
  console.log('All tests passed!');
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Tests failed:', error);
});
```

### Method 3: Manual Testing
```typescript
import { createRoom, joinRoom, subscribeToRoom } from '../services/roomService';

// Create a room
const roomCode = await createRoom('user123');
console.log('Room code:', roomCode);

// Subscribe to updates
const unsubscribe = subscribeToRoom(roomCode, (roomData) => {
  console.log('Room updated:', roomData);
});

// Join from another device/simulator
await joinRoom(roomCode, 'user456');

// Cleanup
unsubscribe();
```

## Integration with Existing Game Logic

The room system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing game logic:

1. **Room Creation**: Host creates room, selects category, and is automatically added to players array AS A PLAYER
2. **Host is Player**: The host is both the room controller AND a game participant in the players list  
3. **Automatic Navigation**: Both host and joining players are automatically navigated to same room screen
4. **Unified Room Screen**: Shows live player list (including host), category, real-time updates for ALL participants
5. **Player Joining**: Players join using room codes and see same room screen as host
6. **Game Start**: Host initiates game, room state changes to 'playing', ALL players (including host) navigate to GameScreen
7. **Multiplayer Game**: Host participates in game alongside other players - can answer questions normally
8. **Game End**: Update room state to 'finished'

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Room
```typescript
const hostId = 'user_123';
const category = 'Movies';  // Required category
const maxPlayers = 4;

try {
  const roomCode = await createRoom(hostId, category, maxPlayers);
  console.log(`Room created: ${roomCode} (Category: ${category})`);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to create room:', error.message);
}
```

### Joining a Room
```typescript
const roomCode = 'ABC123';
const playerId = 'user_456';

try {
  await joinRoom(roomCode, playerId);
  console.log('Successfully joined room');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to join room:', error.message);
}
```

### Real-time Room Updates
```typescript
const unsubscribe = subscribeToRoom('ABC123', (roomData) => {
  if (roomData) {
    console.log(`Players: ${roomData.players.length}`);
    console.log(`Game State: ${roomData.gameState}`);
    console.log(`Host: ${roomData.hostId}`);
    console.log(`Players list: [${roomData.players.join(', ')}]`); // Includes host!
    
    // Update UI based on room data
    setPlayers(roomData.players);
    setGameState(roomData.gameState);
    
    // Host is both in players array AND has host privileges
    const isCurrentUserHost = roomData.hostId === currentUserId;
    const isCurrentUserPlayer = roomData.players.includes(currentUserId);
    // Both will be true for the host!
  }
});

// Remember to cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Room Not Found**: Clear error message when joining non-existent room
2. **Room Full**: Prevents joining when room is at capacity
3. **Game Already Started**: Prevents joining rooms in progress
4. **Invalid Input**: Validates room codes and player IDs
5. **Network Issues**: Graceful failure handling
6. **Duplicate Joins**: Handles players already in room

## Performance Considerations

- Room codes use efficient document lookup by ID
- Real-time subscriptions only listen to specific room documents
- Automatic cleanup of subscriptions prevents memory leaks
- Error boundaries prevent crashes from network issues

## Security Considerations

- All operations validated server-side by Firestore rules
- Player IDs should come from authenticated users
- Room codes are generated cryptographically random
- No sensitive data stored in room documents

## Next Steps

1. **Game Integration**: Connect room system to actual game flow
2. **Enhanced Security**: Add Firestore security rules
3. **Player Management**: Add kick/ban functionality for hosts
4. **Room Cleanup**: Implement automatic cleanup of old rooms
5. **Advanced Features**: Add spectator mode, room passwords, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to generate code after multiple attempts" Error**:
   - **Cause**: High collision rate due to many existing rooms or network issues
   - **Solution**: Use the debug tools to clean up old rooms and check system health
   - **Prevention**: The system now includes automatic retry logic and fallback generation

2. **Room Creation Fails**: 
   - Check Firebase connection and authentication
   - Use the "System Health Check" button in the test screen
   - Verify your internet connection

3. **Real-time Updates Not Working**: 
   - Verify Firestore permissions and security rules
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure proper subscription cleanup

4. **Players Can't Join**: 
   - Check room code validity (6 characters, alphanumeric)
   - Verify room is still in 'waiting' state
   - Check room capacity (default: 4 players)

5. **Memory Leaks**: 
   - Ensure subscription cleanup in useEffect
   - Use the unsubscribe function returned by subscribeToRoom

### Fixed Issues in Latest Version

âœ… **Room Code Generation Improvements**:
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback generation using timestamps for uniqueness
- Better error messages and debugging
- Crypto-random number generation when available

âœ… **Error Handling Enhancements**:
- Network error detection and specific error messages
- Authentication error detection
- Service availability checks
- Automatic delay between retries for transient issues

âœ… **Debug Tools**:
- System health check functionality
- Room state analysis and debugging

### Debug Commands

```typescript
// NEW: Use improved room creation with retry (REQUIRES CATEGORY)
import { createRoomWithRetry } from '../services/roomService';
const roomCode = await createRoomWithRetry('user123', 'Movies', 4, 3);

// NEW: Run system health check
import { runRoomSystemHealthCheck } from '../utils/roomDebugUtils';
await runRoomSystemHealthCheck();

// NEW: Clean up old rooms to reduce collisions
import { cleanupOldRooms } from '../utils/roomDebugUtils';
const deletedCount = await cleanupOldRooms(120); // Remove rooms older than 2 hours

// Check room data directly (now includes category)
const roomData = await getRoomData('ABC123');
console.log(roomData); // Shows category field

// Run full test suite
await runAllTests();

// Debug room state
import { debugRoomsState } from '../utils/roomDebugUtils';
await debugRoomsState();
```

### Using the Debug Tools in Test Screen

The RoomTestScreen now includes debug tools at the bottom:

1. **System Health Check**: Tests Firebase connectivity, analyzes room state, and checks code generation performance
2. **Debug Rooms State**: Shows current rooms, their ages, and states
3. **Cleanup Old Rooms**: Removes rooms older than 1 hour to reduce collision probability

These tools help diagnose and fix the "failed to generate code" error automatically.
