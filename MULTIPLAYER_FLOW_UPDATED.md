## Key Changes

### âœ… **Fixed Flow Logic:**
- **Host MUST pick category first** (Categories screen â†’ Create Room)
- **Join players NEVER pick category** (Enter code â†’ Join existing room)
- **Category comes from the room** for joining players

### âœ… **Updated Modes:**
- `role_select`: Choose Host vs Join
- `category_select`: Host confirms category and creates room  
- `joining`: Player enters room code
- `waiting`: Room lobby with players
- `creating`: Loading state for room creation

### âœ… **Smart Navigation:**
- **Main Menu** â†’ Role selection (not categories)
- **"Host Game"** â†’ Categories â†’ Room creation  
- **"Join Game"** â†’ Room code input â†’ Join room
- **Back button** behaves correctly for each mode

### âœ… **UI Headers:**
- `role_select`: "Multiplayer" - "Choose your role"
- `category_select`: "Create Room" - "{categoryName}"  
- `joining`: "Join Room" - "Enter room code"
- `waiting`: "Room" - "{categoryName}"
