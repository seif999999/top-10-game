## Debug Information

Check the console logs for:
```
ðŸŽ¯ MultiplayerRoomScreen params: { categoryName: "Sports", categoryId: "Sports", joinedRoomCode: undefined, isHost: true }
ðŸŽ¯ Initial mode: category_select
```

This confirms the fix is working!

## What Was Fixed

### **Before (Broken):**
- Categories â†’ MultiplayerRoom (categoryName: "Sports", categoryId: "Sports")
- Mode logic: `categoryName ? 'category_select' : 'role_select'`
- **Problem:** Couldn't distinguish between host and join flows

### **After (Fixed):**
- Categories â†’ MultiplayerRoom (categoryName: "Sports", categoryId: "Sports", **isHost: true**)
- Mode logic: `(categoryName && isHostParam) ? 'category_select' : 'role_select'`
- **Solution:** `isHost` parameter identifies host flow correctly

## Expected Flow

### ðŸŽ¯ **Host Path:**
```
Main Menu â†’ Multiplayer â†’ Host Game â†’ Categories â†’ Pick Category â†’ Create Room â†’ Room Lobby
```

### ðŸŽ® **Join Path:**
```
Main Menu â†’ Multiplayer â†’ Join Game â†’ Enter Code â†’ Room Lobby (with host's category)
```

The navigation should now work exactly as you wanted! ðŸŽ‰
